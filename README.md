### Glad we met! - My name is minecon099
Welcome to my ReadMe.md Profile!
I'm currently a normal and average programmer who wishes to create the best utilities bot ever, and with his little and tiny brain and his wishes to procrastinate a lot, plus the extra homework that makes it a pain in the back, he will make it in over a thousand years! (Maybe of course, maybe)

What I'm up to:
- Creating little tools for daily life in Python 3.9+
- A really messed up Discord Bot, which is also in Python and will never be online cos im poor fr
- Trying to create a calculator that can solve even the most longest mathematical equations without any limits or restrictions (But probably won't as Python is restricted as far as I see)
- Getting 5‚≠ê characters in Genshin Impact (Crying for so many 4 stars)
- Procrastinating with other Videogames and Skephalo stuff (Top 1 priority)

### Languages?
Yeah so...

Umm...

Python 

That is it

### What will you do in the future?
You know sometimes in your work they tell you to go with casual clothing? - If you see a smol man in the streets that wears some sneakers that is probably me walking around as the sketchers man üòé

Sides apart from that you would see me going to Nintendo(c) Headquarters

### How may I speak to you?
That is real hard my boy, if you want to talk with me you should contact me on Discord v√≠a Pogamepayer#3492 or if you are very lucky you can contact me in any other social networks (Including my personal facebook)
